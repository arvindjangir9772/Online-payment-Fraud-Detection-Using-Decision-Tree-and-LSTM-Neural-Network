# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility and development scripts used during the project development.

## Contents

### Model Creation Scripts
- `create_lstm_model.py` - Initial LSTM model creation
- `create_simple_lstm.py` - Simplified LSTM model version
- `create_compatible_lstm.py` - Compatibility-focused LSTM model
- `create_better_lstm.py` - Enhanced LSTM model version

### Debug Scripts
- `debug_lstm.py` - LSTM model debugging utilities
- `debug_models.py` - General model debugging tools
- `debug_new_model.py` - Debugging for new model versions

### Utility Scripts
- `re_save.py` - Re-save models with updated scikit-learn version for compatibility
- `simple_train.py` - Simplified training script for quick testing

## Note

These scripts were used during development and experimentation. The main training pipeline is located in `ml_pipeline/train_models.py`.
