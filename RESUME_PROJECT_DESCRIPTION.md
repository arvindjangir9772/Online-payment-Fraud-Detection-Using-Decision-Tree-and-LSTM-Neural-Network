## 📝 Sample Cover Letter Paragraph

"During my 14-week project developing an Advanced Hybrid Fraud Detection System, I engineered a machine learning solution that achieved 98.4% accuracy by combining LSTM neural networks and Decision Tree models. I built a scalable FastAPI backend with 20+ RESTful endpoints and integrated SHAP explainability for transparent fraud predictions. The system processes transactions in real-time (0.15s per transaction) and handles batch processing efficiently (0.5s per 100 transactions). This project demonstrated my ability to work across the full ML stack—from data preprocessing and model development to API design and frontend implementation—while maintaining focus on performance, explainability, and user experience."
